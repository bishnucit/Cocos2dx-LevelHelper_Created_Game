This project has some runtime bugs .. to run this project you need to ignore 3 runtime warnings then it will load the game. Now the problem here lies with the different versions of cocos2dx i work with where the resolution changes with versions so if you see black screen just try to improvise on the main.cpp page changing resolutions iff the build shows black screen. I will fix this later.
